## Which tools will we use?
The toolbox for capturing and evaluating of visual attention consists of multiple, different parts:
- Config File :wrench:
- Tool: Bubble View :wind_chime:
- Tool: Zoom Maps :mag:
- Tool: Code Charts :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Tool: Webcam based Eyetracking :eyes:
- Storage for collected data :floppy_disk:
- Client for analysing of the data :microscope:

<br />

## Milestone :one:
*Deadline: 05.11.2020*

The first task was to describe the requirements of the different parts, with the help of Volere Snow Cards.
For each tool, a functional as well as a non-functional requirement needs to be described.
#### Enumeration of Volere Snowcard IDs

| **Req-ID's**      | functional | non-functional |
|---------------|:----------:|:--------------:|
| Config File   |   [M01-01F](docs/m01/snowcards/functional/01F.md)  |     [M01-01N](docs/m01/snowcards/non-functional/01N.md)    |

## Milestone :two:
*Deadline: 12.11.2020*

The second task was to analyze all of the components of the toolbox with the help of CRC Cards. All classes, dependencies, responsibilities, collaborations and relations, but also hierarchies (and inheritance) are supposed to be found. Also, the results need some reasing for the chosen arrangements. 

|      Tool     |   ID   |

| Code Charts   | [M02-04](docs/m02/crc_cards/04.md) |
| Eyetracking   | [M02-05](docs/m02/crc_cards/05.md) |
