## Milestone :one:
*Deadline: 05.11.2020*
#### Which tools will we use?
The toolbox for capturing and evaluating of visual attention consists of multiple, different parts:
- Config File :wrench:
- Tool: Bubble View :wind_chime:
- Tool: Code Charts :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Tool: Webcam based Eyetracking :eyes:
- Storage for collected data :floppy_disk:
- Client for analysing of the data :mag:

The first task was to describe the requirements of the different parts, with the help of Volere Snow Cards.
For each tool, a functional as well as a non-functional requirement needs to be described.
#### Enumeration of Volere Snowcard IDs
